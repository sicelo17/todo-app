# todo-app

# Project setup
- Download npm from their official website "https://nodejs.org/en/"
- Install vue 3 by running "npm install -g @vue/cli"
- install dependencies namely "vue-router", "axios", "auth0" using "npm i package-name --save"
- run "npm run serve" to host the app locally

# Problems faced
- unable to run the app because of an error in main.js on line 12 where Vue.use is not a readable property as shown in the console

# areas currently working on
- being able to display the login page when the app is loaded
- redirecting to specific pages on authentication of data

# Things done to try and solve the problem
- I tried searching for an alternative to Vue.use but to no avail

# Areas being affected by the error
- The error is preventing the app from displaying
- There is no authentication that can be done before the error is cleared
